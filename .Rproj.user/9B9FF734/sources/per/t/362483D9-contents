The purpose of redesigning bad graphs is to improve clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness in conveying information. Bad graphs often suffer from issues such as cluttered visuals, misleading representations, inappropriate use of chart types, or inadequate labeling. Redesigning these graphs aims to address these shortcomings, making the data easier to interpret, enhancing communication, and ultimately leading to better-informed decision-making.

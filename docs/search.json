Its market capitalization is represented by the tallest bar on the chart.

When viewers hover over a marker, important details like the name of the site and the overall insurance loss in millions of dollars are revealed, enabling them to comprehend the size and spatial distribution of losses in various areas. Viewers can find trends indicating recurrent incidents or locations prone to particular sorts of disasters by analyzing the map and identifying geographic areas with higher insurance losses.Users can zoom in, pan around the map, and acquire a deeper understanding of the spatial patterns and temporal trends of insurance losses with this interactive visualization that facilitates dynamic exploration. In the end, the visualization aids in risk assessment, strategic planning to lessen the impact of future insurance catastrophes, and informed decision-making for stakeholders in the insurance business, risk management, and disaster preparedness."
